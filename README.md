### Learning LOLCODE (programming language)

I know very little about the LOLCODE programming language. This document will go over all of my knowledge of the LOLCODE programming language.

#### Hello World in LOLCODE

This is how you make a Hello World program in LOLCODE:

```lolcode
HAI 1.2
CAN HAS STDIO?
VISIBLE "HAI WORLD!"
KTHXBYE
```

#### Comments in LOLCODE

Comments in LOLCODE are unique, no other language currently uses comments like LOLCODE does.

##### Single line comments

Single line comments in LOLCODE are written like so:

```lolcode
BTW This is a comment
```

The `BTW` keyword is similar to the `REM` keyword in Batchfile. They both are for comments.

##### Multi-line comments

Multi-line comments in LOLCODE are written like so:

```lolcode
OBTW
This is a multi-line
comment in LOLCODE
TLDR
```

Multi-line comments start with `OBTW` and end with `TLDR`

#### Break keyword in LOLCODE

```lolcode
break;
```

To this day, I am still not entirely sure what the `break` keyword does, but most languages support it.

I am not sure if LOLCODE supports the `break` keyword

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Shebangs in LOLCODE

LOLCODE has version specific Shebang lines. Currently, I only know of 3 that exist.

##### Misc

A miscellaneous LOLCode shebang.

```lolcode
HAI
BTW This is a LOLCODE program
KTHXBYE
```
##### V1.0

A version 1.0 LOLCODE Shebang.

```lolcode
HAI 1.0
BTW This is a LOLCODE 1.0 program
KTHXBYE
```

##### V1.2

A version 1.2 LOLCODE Shebang.

```lolcode
HAI 1.2
BTW This is a LOLCODE 1.0 program
KTHXBYE
```

#### End keyword

The end keyword is written as `KTHXBYE` it is to go at the end of a loop, or at the end of a program.

```lolcode
HAI
BTW I am going to go now
KTHXBYE
```

#### Error handling

LOLCODE supports error handling with the `O NOES` keyword. Error handling can be done like so:

```lolcode
HAI 1.0
CAN HAS STDIO?
PLZ OPEN FILE "/dev/null/"
    AWSUM THX
        VISIBLE FILE
    O NOES
        INVISIBLE "ERROR!"
KTHXBYE
```

#### Standard IO

LOLCODE supports standard input/output through the following keyword:

```lolcode
CAN HAS STDIO?
```

#### Opening files

LOLCODE supports file I/O. To open a file, simply run this:

```plain-text
LOLCATS.txt
```

```lolcode
PLZ OPEN FILE "LOLCATS.TXT"?
    AWSUM THX
        VISIBLE FILE
    O NOES
        INVISIBLE "ERROR!"
```

#### Defining a variable

Defining variables in LOLCODE can be done like so:

```lolcode
I HAS A VAR
```

#### Defining a loop

##### LOLCODE 1.0

Defining a loop in LOLCODE 1.0

```lolcode
HAI 1.0
IM IN YR LOOP
    UP VAR!!1
    VISIBLE VAR
    IZ VAR BIGGER THAN 10? KTHX
IM OUTTA YR LOOP
KTHXBYE
```

##### LOLCODE 1.2

Defining a loop in LOLCODE 1.2

```lolcode
HAI 1.2
CAN HAS STDIO?
IM IN YR LOOP UPPIN YR VAR TIL BOTH SAEM VAR AN 10
    VISIBLE SUM OF VAR AN 1
IM OUTTA YR LOOP
KTHXBYE
```
